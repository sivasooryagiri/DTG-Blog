## Hi, I'm SivaSoorya — also known as DeadTechGuy

DeadTechGuy is more than just a blog. It’s a digital space where I document my journey through technology, machine learning, deep learning, and the ideas that shape the future of software and innovation.  

I don’t see this website as just a content platform — it’s an extension of my thinking process. Some posts are deep technical explorations, others are short insights that don’t need a full video but still deserve to exist.

## Why this website exists

Technology moves fast, and learning publicly helps me stay consistent. Here you’ll find:

- Thoughts on machine learning and AI
- Experiments and research notes
- Tech opinions and observations
- Personal learnings from building projects

This space is built for curiosity — not perfection.

## My Background

I’m a self-driven learner focused on modern technology, especially machine learning and deep learning. I enjoy breaking down complex ideas, building things from scratch, and exploring how systems actually work under the hood.

Rather than following a traditional path, I prefer learning by building, experimenting, and sharing what I discover along the way.

## Philosophy

DeadTechGuy is about mindset:

- Learn deeply  
- Think independently  
- Build consistently  
- Share honestly  

Not every post will be polished — and that’s intentional. Progress matters more than perfection.

## Let’s Connect

If you enjoy thoughtful tech content, experimental ideas, or discussions around AI and innovation, you’re in the right place.

You can reach out through the contact page or connect with me through my socials.

_Let’s keep building and exploring._
